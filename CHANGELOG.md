# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Repository metadata, clone URLs, issue links, and the viewer changelog now point at [vili-pet/memoryvaultbypierre](https://github.com/vili-pet/memoryvaultbypierre) instead of `guirguispierre/memoryvault`.
- Cloudflare setup is documented in `docs/cloudflare.md` with an idempotent `scripts/init-cloudflare.sh` workflow for local and remote D1, KV, and Vectorize.
- MCP client examples for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Claude Code live under `examples/mcp/` with placeholders only.

### Added
- Viewer settings panel now supports folder-style expandable sections (`General & Search`, `Graph Defaults`, `Appearance & Session`, `Notifications`, `Semantic Index`) to reduce visual overload.
- Viewer settings now include a scrollable settings body so long configurations remain usable on smaller viewports while action buttons stay accessible.
- `memory_reindex` now supports `wait_for_index` (default `true`) and `wait_timeout_seconds` (default `180`) so callers can block until semantic mutations are queryable.
- `memory_reindex` response now includes semantic indexing readiness fields (`index_ready`, `mutation_count`, wait timing, and processed mutation markers).
- `/view` settings include Semantic Index Sync controls (limit, wait toggle, timeout, run button, and readiness status panel).
- Command palette includes a `Reindex semantic memory` action for in-app semantic maintenance.
- Browser auth responses now issue and rotate httpOnly `auth_token` / `refresh_token` cookies for sign-up, login, refresh, and logout flows.
- OAuth redirect handling now includes trusted self-registration domains for hosted MCP clients (`poke.com`, `claude.ai`) alongside explicit redirect-domain configuration.
- CORS allowlisting now explicitly includes `https://poke.com` plus the dev and prod Worker origins used by embedded clients.
- `/view.js` now serves the viewer script from a same-origin asset path so the existing CSP can allow it without `unsafe-inline`.
- Cloudflare Worker auth now binds a dedicated `RATE_LIMIT_KV` namespace in both prod and dev for deployed brute-force protection.

### Changed
- Settings modal layout was refactored from a single long flat list into grouped sections using native expandable containers, while preserving all existing setting field IDs and persistence behavior.
- Settings modal now uses a constrained-height container with internal scrolling (`max-height` + `overflow-y`) for better desktop and mobile usability.
- Mobile settings presentation was tuned to keep section content readable and maintain full-width action buttons.
- Semantic reindex workflow now surfaces readiness signals directly in the viewer status card, including mutation counters and completion state.
- Semantic indexing mutation identifiers now use a parseable/stable format to improve cross-operation consistency between write paths and retrieval.
- OAuth dynamic client registration now requires `ADMIN_TOKEN` unless every `redirect_uri` is on a trusted hosted-client domain, and stale non-whitelisted clients are purged during registration attempts.
- OAuth metadata and authorization validation now enforce `S256` PKCE only, and the smoke test flow now covers the stricter registration/auth requirements.
- Login and signup requests now use a Cloudflare KV-backed rate limiter with 15-minute TTL windows, while authenticated browser/API requests can use cookie-backed auth tokens in addition to bearer headers.
- `/view` UI actions are now bound with `addEventListener` and `data-action` hooks instead of inline `onclick`/`oninput` handlers.

### Fixed
- Semantic retrieval failures caused by non-parseable vector record identifiers were resolved by switching to a parse-safe vector ID strategy.
- Newly created memories now reliably participate in semantic retrieval flows after indexing operations.
- Hybrid retrieval reliability improved by ensuring reindex completion can wait for Vectorize readiness before returning control to callers.
- Mutating MCP tools (including `memory_link`/`memory_unlink`) are now correctly available to authenticated user sessions; write access is no longer incorrectly gated on OAuth `client_id` presence.
- Trusted Poke/Claude redirect URIs can now complete MCP dynamic client registration without manual preregistration, while non-trusted domains still require admin approval.
- CORS responses now reflect only allowlisted origins on both preflight and actual responses instead of falling back to `*`.
- `/view` buttons and interactive controls now work under the strict Content-Security-Policy without relaxing `script-src`.
- Concurrent auth attempts now rate-limit consistently by recording one expiring KV key per request instead of racing on a shared counter key.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- `memory_context_pack` MCP tool — one-call working-memory assembly. Retrieves relevant memories for a task (lexical/semantic/hybrid), expands 0-2 hops through positively weighted graph relations, excludes superseded memories and resolved-conflict losers (reported in an `excluded` block), and greedily packs the highest-utility memories into a token budget. Returns a citation-ready `context` string plus per-memory metadata (`ref`, `relevance`, `utility`, `tokens_estimate`, `truncated`, `included_via`).
- Packed memories are recorded as accessed, so using context strengthens the memories it draws on.
- New pure helpers in `src/retrieval.ts`: `estimateTokens`, `packContextEntries` (greedy utility packing with one truncated partial entry when ≥120 tokens remain).

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- `memory_search` results include a `retrieval` block per row (`fused_score`, `relevance_score`, plus `superseded_by` / `conflict_loser` annotations when applicable).
- New `src/retrieval.ts` module with pure, unit-tested ranking functions (`rankLexicalRows`, `rankSearchResults`).

### Changed
- Lexical search candidates are now ranked by weighted field relevance (title > key > tags > source > content, with phrase bonus) instead of `created_at DESC`, so rank fusion receives genuine relevance order.
- Final search order blends normalized fused retrieval scores (75%) with dynamic importance/confidence (25%) across the full candidate pool *before* slicing to the limit — dynamic scores now affect what gets retrieved, not just how results are decorated.
- Memories that have been superseded, or that lost a resolved conflict, are down-ranked and annotated instead of ranking identically to their canonical counterparts.
- Lexical candidate pool widened (up to 120 rows) so re-ranking has more to work with.
- Access recording now applies to the final returned results rather than the pre-ranking candidate set.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- Retrieval access tracking: `memory_search`, `memory_get`, `memory_get_fact`, and `memory_activate` now record `access_count` and `last_accessed_at` on returned memories, so recall strengthens memories over time.
- Dynamic scoring model `memoryvault-dynamic-v2` with `usage_signal` (log-scaled access frequency) and `recall_recency_signal` components; staleness and recency now count from the last write *or* recall instead of write-time only.
- `memory_decay` responses include per-memory `idle_days` and `decay_periods` for explainability.

### Changed
- `memory_decay` decrements now scale with idle periods elapsed (time-proportional) instead of applying a flat amount per invocation, and `older_than_days` defaults to the brain policy `decay_days` instead of a hardcoded 30.
- `memory_decay` protects recently recalled memories: idle time counts from the last write, recall, or prior decay (tracked via a new `last_decayed_at` column).
- `memory_spaced_repetition` staleness now measures time since last write or recall, and results include `access_count`.

### Fixed
- `memory_decay` and `memory_reinforce` no longer bump `updated_at` on score-only writes. Previously this reset the staleness penalty and granted a recency bonus, so decaying a stale memory could *increase* its dynamic importance.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `memory_merge` MCP tool for merging two or more overlapping memories into a single richer memory, combining content, tags, and graph links while archiving duplicates with supersedes relationships.
- `memory_temporal_cluster` MCP tool for retrieving memories grouped by time windows (hour/day/week) with surrounding graph context — episodic memory recall by time period.
- `memory_spaced_repetition` MCP tool for surfacing important but fading memories due for review, scored by urgency based on importance, confidence gap, staleness, and graph isolation.
- Viewer update banner that surfaces new tools and changes on login, with dismiss functionality (persisted per-version in localStorage).

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Hybrid semantic retrieval for `memory_search` with `mode` (`lexical`, `semantic`, `hybrid`), `limit`, and `min_score`.
- New `memory_reindex` MCP tool for semantic backfill/repair of existing memories.
- Cloudflare Workers AI + Vectorize bindings in Wrangler config (`AI`, `MEMORY_INDEX`).

### Changed
- Memory write/archival paths now sync vector state (save, update, delete, consolidate, forget, objective upserts, entity archive, snapshot restore).
- Server and package versions bumped to `1.9.0`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- Human-friendly root landing page at `/` for browser navigation.
- New **Dev Section** on the root page that lists sub-sites and endpoint surfaces with method/auth summaries.
- Viewer command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+K`) for quick actions (refresh, graph, toggles, focus, logout).
- Viewer keyboard shortcuts overlay (`?`) with inline key reference.
- Viewer toast notifications for auth, graph, and sync actions.
- Viewer settings panel for user preferences (live polling, time mode, compact cards, graph defaults, auto-open graph, toast toggle), persisted in local storage.
- Expanded viewer settings with startup filter, search debounce, toast duration, logout confirmation, graph hover-focus toggle, scanline toggle, and reduced-motion mode.
- Viewer settings now show the running app version and include an in-app changelog viewer backed by `tool_changelog`.

### Changed
- MCP auth now distinguishes read-only human sessions from writable AI-agent sessions using OAuth `client_id` context.
- `tools/list` now hides mutating tools for read-only sessions.

### Fixed

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- `memory_tag_stats` MCP tool for tag frequency and co-occurrence analytics.
- `memory_graph_stats` MCP tool for graph topology metrics (density, components, relation counts, hubs, and top tags).

- Graph toolbar physics toggle (`PHYSICS ON/OFF`) in the web viewer.
- Browser-friendly endpoint guides for `/mcp` and machine endpoints (`/auth/*`, `/api/*`, `/register`, `/token`, and `/.well-known/*`) when opened via normal browser navigation.
- Human-readable `/mcp` landing page explaining MCP purpose, connection steps, and key discovery URLs.

### Changed
- Web graph exploration now supports hover neighborhood focus to spotlight a node and its immediate connections.
- Graph node/link opacity behavior was refined for smoother search/focus transitions.
- Server/tool version metadata bumped to `1.8.0`.

### Fixed
- OAuth `/authorize` requests that include authorization flow parameters now correctly render the login/sign-up authorization screen instead of the generic endpoint guide page.

### Added
- OAuth authorize page now supports `Use Legacy Token` for pre-account users.
